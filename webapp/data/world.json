By the way, here's the antidote.\"\n\nAs you drink the potion Eleanor hands you, the sirens get closer.

She has strange hallucinations. They're becoming much more frequent.\n\nI came home yesterday to find our cat skinned and gutted like fish, marinating in garlic butter like a fish. Eleanor thought poor Tootsie was our dinner.\n\nI have isolate the strain that is causing her disease, and I am confident I will find a cure. I must do so, for Eleanor's sake.\n\nFebruary 3rd, 3 PM. I have created a possible cure for Eleanor's strange disease. I am unsure of the possible side-effects, but I will not endanger Eleanor's life any more than I have to. I need to find a test subject.\n\nFebruary 13th, 9 PM. I have found a test subject for my experiments. A man was walking outside our house last week, and I figured he would not be missed. I injected him with the disease 5 days ago. He began showing symptoms 48 hours later. I have now given him my serum. I estimate it will take 2 days to fully work. I will check back on the subject in 48 hours to check my results.\n\nFebruary 15th, 8:30 PM. The serum was a failure. The subject showed advanced progressions of the disease until heart failure. I have removed vital organs for testing and stored subject in the freezer.\n\nI have some idea of what went wrong. Serum #2 should work, but now I need another test subject."

Then you must be one of the ... subjects. How did you get free?\"\n\n\"Nevermind. We have to get out of here. Wait! I just remembered. Do you know if you've been injected yet?\"\n\n\"Oh no. You see, my husband, he's crazy. He used to work at the chemical plant in town. He was a top scientist, but then, something happened. There was an accident. And he never told me anything but I could tell something was wrong with him. I later found out that he was fired from the plant. He became very depressed and angry, and he started showing signs of paranoia and hallucinations. I'll never forget what happened to our poor cat Tootsie. It was about then that I found out about his tests. He was kidnapping people and injecting them with some disease. I saw his journal and it looked like he was trying to create an army of supermutated monsters. I think he wants to get back at the chemical plant for firing him.\n\nI was about to call the police when he locked me in this room. You see, his hallucinations have led him to believe that I'm the one who's crazy. It's been terrible. He leaves me here in the dark, feeding me twice a day. I used to be able to move around, but a couple weeks ago he started tying me to the bed after he leaves. I can get my hands free, but I can't try the straps. At night, I can hear strange noises from the basement bellow. I shudder every time I hear them. They're grotesque sounding.\n\nBut enough talk. We have to get you the antidote! Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I'm the head scientist at EKMC laboratories in town. But first you have to cut me loose. Do you have a knife with you?\""

He fails to realize, however, that they won't stop there. As soon as they're out, he'll lose control over them! They'll wreak havoc upon the entire town!\"\n\n\"And the ones in the basement are just the tip of the iceberg. There are more. Many more. We have a small barn just down the road. I'm sure he keeps them there. We must find a way to destroy it.\"\n\n\"But, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me create an antidote for you. It'll take a few minutes.
